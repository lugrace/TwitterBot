# TwitterBot
If the user enters a twitter handle, then the java program will give back the handle's most common word (minus already common words such as 'a' and 'and', etc). In addition, the program can also post onto your twitter and retweet any tweets with the words 'giveaway'. The key word, 'giveaway' can be changed so anything the user wants can be retweeted.
